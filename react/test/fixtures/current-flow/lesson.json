  "intro": "This is a warm up question on the behavior of P-N junction diodes.",
  "question": "With a DC input source, does current flow in the same or the opposite direction of the diode arrow?",

    {

    "Summing up, this diode is forward biased. Positive current flows in the same direction of the arrow, from anode to cathode.",
