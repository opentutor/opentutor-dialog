  intro:
    '_user_, this is a warm up question on the behavior of P-N junction diodes.',
  question:
    'With a DC input source, does current flow in the same or the opposite direction of the diode arrow?',
  expectations: [

      expectationId: '0',
      expectation: 'Current flows in the same direction as the arrow.',

    'Summing up, this diode is forward biased. Positive current flows in the same direction of the arrow, from anode to cathode.',
