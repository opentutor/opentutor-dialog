  "intro": "_user_, this is a warm up question on the behavior of P-N junction diodes.",
  "question": "With a DC input source, does current flow in the same or the opposite direction of the diode arrow?",
  "expectations": [
    {
      "expectationId": "0",
      "expectation": "Current flows in the same direction as the arrow.",

        }

    }

  "conclusion": [
    "Summing up, this diode is forward biased. Positive current flows in the same direction of the arrow, from anode to cathode.",
    "Let's try a different problem."
